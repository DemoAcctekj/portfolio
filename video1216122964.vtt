00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:08.999
Hey everyone, this is a quick video to go over, um, some of the highlights of Exercise 8 Chatbot.

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:16.203
Um, so the first thing you want to do is, you know, interrogate a chatbot of your choice.

00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:23.984
And really push its limits. What information does it share? What's accurate? What's not accurate? What does it know? What doesn't it know?

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:32.733
Um, what is it allowed to say and not allowed to say? Like, basically, what can you tell about what's, like, behind the interface, what it was trained on?

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:41.081
based on, like, the responses you get, um, from different things that you ask it. And don't be afraid to, like, rephrase your questions and really try to…

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:44.311
push it and see what, um, see what you can see.

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:47.505
And then you're going to create your own chatbot.

00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:53.491
Um, and there are a bunch of different options in the module. There's a chatbot resources page.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:57.588
Um, several other, um, helpful things in the module.

00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:00.952
And then, um, let's see, lots of pages there.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.380
And then the, um…

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:09.429
What I'm looking at today is bot press, and I've created a bot in BotPress. Well, I've almost created it.

00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:13.138
I wanted to show you this screen, because I didn't want you to panic.

00:01:13.627 --> 00:01:16.627
Um, please do not pay any AI company for any…

00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:20.057
chatbots. Um, nothing for this class.

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:25.996
that no assignment should require any kind of subscription or payment to an outside

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:32.562
source. And so I just wanted you to point out, you don't have to buy this plan, you don't have to contact us.

00:01:32.848 --> 00:01:38.848
You can just click Not Now over here in the corner. So let's click that and see if my bot is actually done.

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.841
What I did was… oh boy, that's fun.

00:01:44.058 --> 00:01:47.058
Cool. Okay, so I uploaded… I exported the course.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.674
And it exported in some weird file that I had to then

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.249
convert, and so, like, some of the pages

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:59.472
exported just fine, and some didn't, and some unpublished old pages exported, so…

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:09.108
Uh, it's anyone's guess what this thing is gonna say, but that's besides the point for my demo right now. What I'm gonna do is show you how to get from here

00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:17.177
to, um, putting it on your GitHub if you want. It's totally fine to just share the link to your bot. Where is it? Share.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.629
The link to your bot, and you just click this here.

00:02:20.693 --> 00:02:22.693
And click Share.

00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:26.882
I don't know why it called itself Voyant Digital Assistant, but there it is.

00:02:27.606 --> 00:02:30.606
And..oh, it found my phone. That's fun. Alright, so I'm gonna just…

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.543
Copy this. Is it copied already? Let's find it.

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:44.504
Alright, cool. Now I'm going to go to my, um, GitHub demo page, and I'll show you how to just add that in, uh, in case you have forgotten.

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:55.165
Okay, so here is my main, like, code site here in GitHub.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.020
And I want to look for my main page. Actually, I don't want this on my main index page. I want it on my Schedule.md page.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:13.490
Because I think that's where… yep, that's where all my projects are. So I want to add to this, I'm going to add another link to another project.

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.859
And, um, it doesn't have to be hosted in GitHub, it can just be hosted by whatever

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:23.528
Um, platform you're using, so mine will just link out to the bot press…

00:03:23.928 --> 00:03:25.928
Um, chatbot, and that's fine with me.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.130
If you want to get super impressive,

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:35.786
You can upload it to GitHub somehow. I'm not even sure how I would export.

00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.521
a commercial platform's chatbot, but if you can, have at it.

00:03:40.993 --> 00:03:48.993
Okay, so I have hit edit, and I am in Schedule.md, and this is ".md" so it's Markdown, okay? And we remember Markdown text.

00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:55.643
I'm gonna put it here, um, just before the research. I like my things in chronological order. You can do whatever you want.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.849
As far as organizing these, and I'm going to call this, "Impressive 

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:03.076
Chatbot"

00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:05.837
Here, let's call it that.

00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:08.778
And then they need to link to it, and I,

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.832
I think I already lost that link, so I'm gonna go click here again, share…

00:04:14.827 --> 00:04:17.827
And share, and copy…

00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:20.683
Copy…

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.829
Do we think it's copied yet? There.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:28.055
Alright, now I need to… oh, I have to close this before I can go anywhere else.

00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.101
Okay, so I'm back here, now I'm gonna put my whole link.

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:40.041
Now, it's not a .html or a .md, I'm linking to an outside website, and that's fine.

00:04:40.198 --> 00:04:42.198
And it should work there. So let's preview.

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:48.042
And make sure it works. And I have to right-click and open in a new tab so that it doesn't…

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:51.214
Um, leave this page without me checking it.

00:04:51.636 --> 00:04:53.636
And… there it is.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.210
Alright. I'm still annoyed, so I would have to go back and adjust this, because I don't know why it says Voyant, but…

00:05:00.808 --> 00:05:04.808
Either way, that is how you put this link here, and I can commit my changes.

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:07.402
Don't forget to save.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
And then it will build. Remember, it takes a while.

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:17.294
And so, once this is a nice little green check, like that, it will be up.

00:05:18.274 --> 00:05:22.274
So, you can post, um… you can still post the direct link from

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:25.116
bot press, or from wherever you made your bot.

00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:27.245
to the, um, discussion?

00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:29.603
But if you want, you can definitely

00:05:29.736 --> 00:05:33.736
also link to your schedule.md page, and we can find it from there.

00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.571
Alright, hope that helps. Happy chatbotting.
